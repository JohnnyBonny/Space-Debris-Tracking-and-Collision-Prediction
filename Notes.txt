1. grab all the TLE files for the debris and active satellites(1)
  -understand what each of the categories means


2.Understanding Orbital Mechanics
-----
  (This section is the things ive learned(25-27))
  -perigee(2): the point closets to the object it is rotating
  -Apogee(2):  the point farthest to the object it is rotating

  -2 body problem: Assumes that 2 bodies exist(one small and one big)(3)
    -central body is round(like the earth)
    -mass of central body is distributed evenly
    -the large body only influnces the small body, and the small body does not influnce the big body
    -inertial frame, the axis, is in the middle of the large body

  -Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation(3): 
  Force of gravity on the small body 
  =
  (mass of the large body x mass of the small body x Gravitational constant) /(the distance geometric center to the small object)^2

  mass of the large body x Gravitational constant = mew

  can be rewritten as:

  Force of gravity on the small body 
  = mew/ disance between geometric center of the big object and the small object


  Force is also:
  F = mass x acceleration

  so the acceleration of the small object can be calcuated as the:
  acceleration = mew/ disance between geometric center of the big object and the small object

  - ODE:
    the relationship of a function that can be derived by another function.

    example 1: 
    if we know the position relative to time. we can take the derivative of that and get the velocity.

    Once we know the Velocity, we can take the derivative of that and get the Acceleration

    thus from position, we know the velocity and acceleration

    - Euler's method is an example of how we can find the solution of an ode by finding the derivative of some parts of curve and then connecting them.

    -Things to consider when creating simulations:
    Permutations(6): in short, 
    • Drag
    • Non-spherical Earth
    • Lunar Gravity
    • Solar Radiation
    • Tidal Effects

    all affect how an object orbits
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------



3. apply orbital mechanics to the TLE data
--------
  -Calculate orbital period (T) in seconds (where n is mean motion) (4): T=24.0∗3600.0 / n


  -Calculate the semi-major axis:

    -got plantary data from this git: 
      https://github.com/alfonsogonzalez/AWP/blob/main/docs/planetary_data.js

  -Calculate the eccentric anomaly by using the mean anomaly:

  -After calculating the eccentric anomaly, we will now be able to calculate the true anomaly

----------
(This section is the things ive learned(25-27))
 - Figure out how I can get the TLE data to the code editor
 - On Once I have the data, figure out a way to parse the data
 - Once the data has been parse figure out ways i can get the positional and velocity vectors of the object
  -in Order to do this I will need to get the Classical Orbital Elements, from this i will be able to find the vectors for the position and velocity(7. READ THIS LATER).
    - 


4. plot the data

5. evaluate the data

6.Predict if there will be a collision with all the objects within the next 10(days, weeks,months...)
  -method for doing so:
